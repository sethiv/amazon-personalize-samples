Amazon Personalize Batch Recommendations
---

Use an asynchronous batch workflow to get recommendations from large datasets that do not require real-time updates. For instance, you might create a batch inference job to get product recommendations for all users on an email list, or to get item-to-item similarities (SIMS) across an item catalog. To get batch recommendations, you can create a batch inference job by calling the CreateBatchInferenceJob API.
