    "## Agenda\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level working with Amazon Personalize follows the steps in the diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![FlowDiagram](static/imgs/personalize_process.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific process that you will be following is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Imports and Setup\n",
    "1. Preparing Your Data\n",
    "1. Importing Your Data\n",
    "1. Selecting a Recipe\n",
    "1. Training a Solution\n",
    "1. Deploying a Campaign\n",
    "1. Getting Recommendations\n",
    "1. Real-Time Interactions\n",
    "1. Conclusion\n",
    "1. Bonus: Bulk Export of Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these steps you'll see and execute code snippets written in Python using our Boto3 SDK, these snippets can be modified to be components of your production integration with Personalize. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through the steps to build a recommendation model for movies that are tailored to specific users, the goal is to recommend movies based on that users' history of positive interactions with movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is provided via the [MovieLens Project](https://movielens.org), you can read more about it later if you are interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The content below has been written to guide you through the process within the timeline of a workshop session. You can deploy the CloudFormation template you found on GitHub later to your own account and can walk through notebooks 1-3 to do the same exercise again. Additionally you can update the content in the cells to reflect your own data and it is an effective path to building a custom recommendaiton model for your use case.\n",

    "## How to Use the Notebook\n",

    "Code is broken up into cells like the one below. There's a triangular `Run` button at the top of this page you can click to execute each cell and move onto the next, or you can press `Shift` + `Enter` or `Shift` + `Return`(Mac Users) while in the cell to execute it and move onto the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a cell is executing you'll notice a line to the side showcase an `*` while the cell is running or it will update to a number to indicate the last cell that completed executing after it has finished exectuting all the code within a cell.\n",
