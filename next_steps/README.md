* Travel and Hospitality

## Workshops

The [workshops/](workshops/) folder contains a list of our most current workshops:

* POC in a Box
* Re:invent 2019

## Data Science Tools

The [data_science/](data_science/) folder contains an example on how to approach visualization of the key properties of your input datasets.

The key components we look out for include:
- Missing data, duplicated events, and repeated item consumptions
- Power-law distribution of categorical fields
- Temporal drift analysis for cold-start applicability
- Analysis on user-session distribution
